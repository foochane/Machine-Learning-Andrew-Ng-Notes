## 1 Welcome
- Grew out of work in AI
- New capability for computers
### Examples:
- Database mining
Large datasets from growth of automation/web.
E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
- Applications can’t program by hand.
E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision.
- Self-customizing programs
E.g., Amazon, Netflix product recommendations
- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI).

## 2 What is machine learning?

* Machine Learning definition

> Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

>Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning
Problem: A computer program is said to learn
from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its
performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.

## 3 Machine learning algorithms:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender
systems.

## 4 Supervised Learning

“right answers” given

 In supervised learning, in every example in
our data set, we are told what is the
"correct answer" that we would have
quite liked the algorithms have predicted
on that example.

## 5 Unsupervised Learning

In Unsupervised Learning, we're given
data that looks different
than data that looks like
this that doesn't have
any labels.

Instead we're just told, here is a data set.
Can you find some structure in the data?
